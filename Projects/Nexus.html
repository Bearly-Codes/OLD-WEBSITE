    <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT IS NEXUS?</h6>
    <p class="smallText leftIndent">Nexus is a home for all of my projects, displaying the skills I've learned and the
      things I've made with them.
      The first project is Nexus itself. I've never been taught HTML, nor is it covered in any classes I've taken.
      It's not a requirement to graduate or something that anyone is forcing me to do. It's a promise that I'll motivate
      myself to make great things.
      In many way Nexus acts as a minimum viable product for a hub for projects. While it'll impress few it acts as a
      definitive mark of what I've done
      and a great place to tell others what I plan to do.
    </p>
    <p class="smallText leftIndent">Nexus will display formats in a format that answers "What is it" or "What does it
      do", "What does it demonstrate", and "What's planned"</p>
    <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT DOES NEXUS DEMONSTRATE?</h6>
    <p class="smallText leftIndent">
      HTML, CSS, and web design are obvious answers, and nexus does clearly show that I can work my way around VS code.
      But beyond the obvious it also
      shows that I can set goals, hold myself accountable, and teach myself. While the skills to self-direct personal
      projects may seem basic
      it's important to show I have them.
    </p>
    <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT IS PLANNED</h6>
    <p class="smallText leftIndent">COMPLETE: Get a first draft of all planned text on the website by the 28th</p>
    <ol class="smallText leftIndent">
      <li>X Sort out how projects are going to be documented: How will each project look? What individual text boxes
        will each one have?</li>
      <li>X Mention Purdue, that I'm in the CS program, and make a whole education section</li>
      <li>X Implement links to social media and other online presences</li>
      <li>X Review text until I'm pretty sure that most text segemnts will stay around the same size, not a finalized
        version but final draft</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="smallText leftIndent">Current Goal: Beautification by January 1st ---Milestone! Website I won't be ashamed
      of attatching to my resume!---</p>
    <ol class="smallText leftIndent">
      <li>Get everything on the page to where it's supposed to be. Make text that's meant to be inline actually inline.
        Consider adding a seperate Project page for each project</li>
      <li>Finalize fonts, font size</li>
      <li>Add a little down arrow on first page</li>
      <li>Work on text colors/background box colors. Agonize over the coloring of every part of the website.</li>
      <li>Make a QR code linked to the website, add it to my resume</li>
    </ol>
