  <h2>Welcome to Nexus</h2>
  <h4>The Home of Everything</h4>
</div>
<div>
  <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT IS NEXUS?</h6>
  <p class="smallText leftIndent">Nexus is a home for all of my projects, displaying the skills I've learned and the things I've made with them. 
    The first project is Nexus itself. I've never been taught HTML, nor is it covered in any classes I've taken.
    It's not a requirement to graduate or something that anyone is forcing me to do. It's a promise that I'll motivate myself to make great things.
    In many way Nexus acts as a minimum viable product for a hub for projects. While it'll impress few it acts as a definitive mark of what I've done
    and a great place to tell others what I plan to do.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT DOES NEXUS DEMONSTRATE?</h6>
  <p class="smallText leftIndent">
    HTML, CSS, and web design are obvious answers, and nexus does clearly show that I can work my way around VS code. But beyond the obvious it also
    shows that I can set goals, hold myself accountable, and teach myself. While the skills to self-direct personal projects may seem basic
    it's important to show I have them.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subsectionHead left">WHAT IS PLANNED</h6>
  <p class="smallText leftIndent">Current Goal: Get a first draft of all planned text on the website by the 28th</p>
  <ol class="smallText leftIndent">
    <li>Sort out how projects are going to be documented: How will each project look? What individual text boxes will each one have?</li>
    <li>Mention Purdue, that I'm in the CS program, and make a whole education section</li>
    <li>Implement links to social media and other online presences</li>
    <li>Review text until I'm pretty sure that most text segemnts will stay around the same size, not a finalized version but final draft</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="smallText leftIndent">Beautification by End of Winter Break (January 10th) ---Milestone! Website I won't be ashamed of attatching to my resume!---</p>
  <ol class="smallText leftIndent">
    <li>Get everything on the page to where it's supposed to be. Make text that's meant to be inline actually inline.</li>
    <li>Finalize fonts, font size</li>
    <li>Work on text colors/background box colors. Agonize over the coloring of every part of the website.</li>
    <li>Make a QR code linked to the website, add it to my resume</li>
  </ol>
